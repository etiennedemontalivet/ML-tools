# ML-tools
Some tools to help to understand some ML-algorithms

## Requirements
If you'd like to execute the notebooks, please install the *requirements.txt*.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Dimensionality reduction
You will find (in the corresponding folder) a notebook that explains step by step the operations which lead to dimensionality reduction using either *Principal Component Analysis* or *Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis*. You can although directly open the *html* in your browser.

## Neural Network visualization tools
You will find a notebook that contains tools to visualize the update of a Dense Neural Network during its backpropagation. A set of hyperparameters is here to be changed and to see the impact on the backpropagation process.

Here is the result of an *overfitting* set of hyperparameters:
